Tensors are typically too small for the GPU, so we should pack multiple tensors
and operate on them at once.

check that the integral o the new patches mathces the integral of the old
patches

nodal limiting? Patch size depends on the order of the dg scheme, not sure why.

For finite volumes, have a halo layer in the patch (1 or 2 wide), fill it with
the neighbor values and compute gradients only locally.
