# DG Solver Configuration
# This file is processed by CMake at build time to generate constexpr constants

# Simulation parameters
simulation:
  end_time: 1.0                    # Total simulation time
  grid_elements: 10            # Number of elements per dimension
  grid_size: 1.0                   # Physical domain size
  offset: [0.0, 0.0]               # Domain offset

# Solver configuration
solver:
  order: 2                      # Polynomial order for basis functions (Order)
  courant: 0.5                      # CFL number for time stepping
  timeintegrator: SSPRK1            # Time integration scheme

# Equation and scenario selection
equation:
  equation: advection               # Options: "advection", "euler"
  scenario: gaussian_wave           # Scenario selection

# Output configuration
output:
  start: 0.0                        # Start time for output (seconds)
  step: 0.001                         # Output interval (seconds)

# Derived from solver configuration
# DOFs depends on equation type:
# - advection: variable (1, 2, 3, etc.)
# - euler: 4 (2D) or 5 (3D)
Dim: 2                            # Spatial dimension (2D or 3D)
DOFs: 3                             # Degrees of freedom per cell (3 for advection with multiple waves)
